# Welcome to Go-Generics-Simple-Doubly-Linked-List!

Hi, This repository contains a simple example of implementing doubly linked list via generics in Go!
As you know, go currently (2022/1) doesn't support generics. But you can test it with BETA version of go. (v1.18beta)


# How to test

1. Go to https://go.dev/dl/ and download **go1.18beta1**.
2. Extract tar.gz file wherever you want. (e.g. /home/username/Desktop/gotest/)
3. clone this repository.
4. cd to repository directory and use "/home/username/Desktop/gotest/bin/go main.go linkedlist.go"

Pull requests are welcomed.
